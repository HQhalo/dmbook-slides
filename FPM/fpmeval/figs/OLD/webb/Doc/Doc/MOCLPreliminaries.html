<p><b>Magnum Opus </b>analyses data to detect patterns (either <a href="MOassociation_rule.html">rules</a>
or <a href="MOitemset.html">itemsets</a>)
that capture potentially interesting regularities within those data.</p>

<p>The data is imported from a text file in one of several supported formats (see <a
href="MOCLDataTypes.html">transaction data and attribute-value data</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Users
typically extract data from a database into a text file in a suitable format.&nbsp; The
data import process supports considerable flexibility in the formats that may be employed.
</p>

<p>Once the data are imported into <b>Magnum Opus</b>, the system performs
a search for patterns.&nbsp; The user can choose between five measures of the importance 
for
a rule and two measures of importance for an itemset (see <a
href="MOsearch_mode.html">search mode</a>).&nbsp; The user also specifies the maximum
number of patterns to be found, and can place further restrictions on patterns to be considered
(see <a href="MOCLcommands.html">commands</a>). </p>

<p>Within the restrictions specified by the user, <b>Magnum
Opus</b> finds the patterns with the highest values on the specified measure of
importance.&nbsp; <strong>Magnum Opus</strong> will only find fewer than the specified
number of patterns if the search is terminated by the user or there are fewer than the
specified number of patterns that satisfy the user specified constraints. </p>
<p><a href="MOCLholdout.html">Holdout evaluation</a> enables potentially spurious 
patterns to be detected and discarded.</p>

<p>The patterns found are recorded&nbsp;to standard output and may optionally be exported to
a comma separated value file suitable for input into a spreadsheet for further analysis.</p>

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="../Tutorial.pdf">tutorial</a> provides an introduction to the system's use.</p>
