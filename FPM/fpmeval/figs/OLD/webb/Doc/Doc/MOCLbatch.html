<h1><font color="#000080">Batch Processing</font></h1>

<p>During normal operation <b>Magnum Opus</b>   issues progress reports to the
terminal.&nbsp; For long operations, however, it is sometimes desirable to run
the system as a background process disconnected from a terminal.&nbsp; A number
of facilities are provided to support such batch processing. </p>

<p>The no-progress-reports <a href="MOCLcommands.html">command line
argument</a> instructs <b>Magnum Opus</b>  not to output progress reports.&nbsp;
This is desirable if the output is redirected to a file.</p>

<p><a href="MOCLsnapshot.html">Snapshots</a> can be used to obtain progress
reports from a batch process.&nbsp; A snapshot produces a file containing the
current percentage of progress through the search process and the number of
rules found so far.</p>
<p>See <a href="MOCLsnapshot.html">Snapshots</a> for an example of how to run <b>Magnum
Opus</b> as a batch job and take a snapshot during rule discovery.&nbsp;</p>
