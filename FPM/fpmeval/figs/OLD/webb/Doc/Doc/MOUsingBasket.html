<h1><font color="#000080">Using Magnum Opus with transaction data: a
tutorial</font></h1>
<p>The following tutorial steps through the process of analyzing the
example transaction
data distributed with Magnum Opus. This simple data represents the type
of data that might
be collected by a supermarket about customer transactions. In this
context it is known as <em>basket
data</em>.&nbsp; As Magnum Opus supports two alternative transaction
data file formats,
the same data has been provided in each format.&nbsp; The file
tutorial.idi describes the
transactions in <a href="MOId-ItemFile.html">identifier-item file</a>
format.&nbsp; The
file tutorial.itl describes the data in <a href="MOItemListFile.html">item
list file</a>
format.&nbsp; Commands are presented for processing both file
formats.&nbsp; Identical
results can be obtained using either format. </p>
<p>This tutorial is designed to be used with Magnum Opus. Carry out the
instructions with
Magnum Opus as you read through the tutorial. </p>
<p>The identifier-item file, tutorial.idi, contains 2583 lines starting
with the
following. </p>
<blockquote> <tt>ID001, bananas</tt> <br>
  <tt>ID002, plums</tt> <br>
  <tt>ID002, lettuce</tt> <br>
  <tt>ID002, tomatoes</tt> <br>
  <tt>ID003, celery</tt> <br>
  <tt>ID003, confectionery</tt> <br>
  <tt>ID004, confectionery</tt> <br>
  <tt>ID005, apples</tt> <br>
  <tt>ID005, carrots</tt> <br>
  <tt>ID005, tomatoes</tt> <br>
  <tt>ID005, potatoes</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>These first 11 lines describe five transactions, each with a
separate identifier.&nbsp;
In all, 1000 transactions are described in the file. </p>
<p>The item-list file, tutorial.itl, contains 1000 lines starting with
the following.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>bananas <br>
plums, lettuce, tomatoes <br>
celery, confectionery <br>
confectionery <br>
apples, carrots, tomatoes, potatoes </tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These five lines describe the same five transactions described in
the first eleven
lines of tutorial.idi (but does not include transaction identifiers). </p>
<p>In the first transaction, ID001, one item only was purchased,
bananas.&nbsp; In the
second transaction, ID002, three items were purchased, plums, lettuce,
and tomatoes.</p>
<h3><a name="tut_run"></a>Search by Leverage</h3>
<p>For the first search we will use the default search mode setting and
perform <a href="MOsearch_mode.html">search by leverage</a>. For ease
of demonstration we will limit
the search to find only ten rules. Because we are performing search by
leverage,
these will be the ten rules with the highest values for leverage that
fulfil all
other specified constraints. </p>
<p>Execute either of the following to process tutorial.idi or
tutorial.itl, respectively.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>mocl identifier-item-file=tutorial.idi max-results=10 <br>
mocl item-list-file=tutorial.itl max-results=10</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the search executes, progress reports will be displayed to
standard error. Note
that different stages of the complex searches performed by Magnum Opus
may have varying
degrees of difficulty. Hence, the rate of progress may vary from time
to time. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h3><a name="tut_view_output"></a>Viewing the output</h3>
<p>When the search is completed, the rules are output to the standard
output.&nbsp;
The output log lists </p>
<ul>
  <li>the name of the data file, </li>
  <li>the number of cases loaded from the data file, </li>
  <li>the number of attribute values in the data, </li>
  <li>the time at which the search commenced, and </li>
  <li>the settings used for the search. </li>
</ul>
<p>These are followed by a list of <a href="MOassociation_rule.html">rules</a>
that were found. </p>
<p>The output of the search by leverage is as follows. A detailed
examination of one of
these rules is provided below. </p>

<h3><a name="tut_assoc_rule"></a>Dissection of a rule</h3>
<p>The first rule is the following.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>tomatoes<br>
is associated with lettuce<br>
with strength = 0.422<br>
coverage = 0.263: 263 cases satisfy the LHS<br>
support = 0.111: 111 cases satisfy both the LHS and the RHS<br>
lift 1.94: the strength is 1.94 times greater than the strength if
there were no association<br>
leverage = 0.0539: the support is 0.0539 (53.9 cases) greater than if
there were no association</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="MOassociation_rule.html">left-hand-side</a> of this
rule is presented on the first line. The <a
 href="MOassociation_rule.html">right-hand-side</a>
follows the words 'is associated with'. This rule indicates that
tomatoes are associated with lettuces more frequently than is the
average over all
transactions. That is, the frequency of association between
transactions that contain both
the left and right hand sides is greater than would normally be
expected. </p>
<p>The following information about the association is displayed in
brackets.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>Coverage=0.263&nbsp;</tt> The coverage is the proportion of
all transactions that contain the LHS of the rule (tomatoes). This is
also expressed as the absolute number of transactions that this
represents. 263 transactions contain the LHS.&nbsp; There are 1000
transactions in the data set. </p>
  <p><tt>Support=0.111 </tt>The support indicates the proportion of
all transactions that contain both the LHS and the RHS of the rule
(tomatoes and lettuce). This is also expressed as the absolute number
of transactions that this represents. 111 transactions contain the
LHS.&nbsp; There are 1000 transactions in the data set. </p>
  <p><tt>Strength=0.422</tt>&nbsp; This indicates the proportion of
those transactions that contain the LHS that also contain the RHS. 263
transactions contain the LHS and 111 of those also satisfy the RHS, so
Strength is calculated as 111/263. </p>
  <p><tt>Lift=1.94</tt>&nbsp; Lift is a measure of how much stronger
than normal is the association between the LHS and RHS. Out of all the
data, 217 transactions contain the RHS. Therefore the strength of
association that would be expected if the LHS and RHS were independent
of each other is 217/1000. Dividing the actual strength by this value
we obtain (111/263)/(217/1000) = 1.94. </p>
  <p><tt>Leverage=0.0539 </tt>Leverage is a measure of the magnitude
of the effect created by the association. This is the proportion of
transactions that exhibit the association in excess of those that would
be expected if the LHS and RHS were independent of each other. If the
two items were independent of each other then the expected proportion
of transactions containing both would be the proportion containing the
LHS (0.263) times the proportion exhibiting the RHS (0.217) = 0.0571.
The proportion exhibiting the association is 0.1110. The difference
between these values is 0.0539. This is also expressed as the number of
cases that this leverage represents (53.9).</p>

<h3><a name="tut_run_lift"></a>Run a search by lift</h3>
<p>Next we will run a search by lift. The first search found the ten
rules with the
highest value for leverage, within the other constraints imposed. This
next search will find the ten rules with the
highest value for lift.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The following commands execute this search on tutorial.idi or
tutorial.itl,
respectively.</p>

<h3><a name="tut_filtering"></a>The effect of filtering</h3>
<p>The examples so far have used the default <a href="MOfiltering.html">filter
mode</a>,
Insignificant. This discards rules that appear to be spurious,
occurring due to
the random effect of adding another item to the left-hand-side of a
genuine association
between items.&nbsp; To illustrate the effect of this feature, we next
re-run the previous
command with filtering disabled, using one of the following commands.</p>

<p>These rules illustrate the value of filtering out spurious
rules. Each contains a combination of items that happens to only occur
once in the data and happens to co-occur with the least frequent item,
celery.&nbsp; As every time the combination occurs it is associated
with celery, the strength is 1.0, resulting in the highest possible
lift. <br>

<h3><a name="tut_itemsets"></a>Search for itemsets<br>
</h3>
<p>The examples so far have found rules.&nbsp; These identify groups of
items that have a particular influence on a single further item.&nbsp;
Sometimes, however, there is no need to identify a particular RHS
item.&nbsp; Rather, the interest is in what groups of items
co-occur.&nbsp; Search for itemsets performs this type of
analysis.&nbsp; The default search mode is search by leverage.&nbsp;
The leverage of an itemset is the number of items it covers in excess
of the maximum that can be account for by assuming independence between
any subsets of the itemset.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
To illustrate this, run one of the following commands.
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>mocl identifier-item-file=tutorial.idi find-itemsets </tt><tt>max-results=10
  </tt><br>
  <tt>mocl item-list-file=tutorial.itl </tt><tt>find-itemsets </tt><tt>max-results=10
  </tt></p>

</p>
<p>To illustrate how leverage is calculated for itemsets, consider the
last of these itemsets.&nbsp; The subset <tt>lettuce &amp; tomatoes</tt>
occurs in 0.111 of all transactions and the item <tt>potatoes</tt>
occurs in 0.283 of all transactions.&nbsp; hence, if they were
independent of each other, they would co-occur in 0.0264 of all
transactions.&nbsp; This is the highest expected coverage obtained by
any combination of subsets of the itemset, so the leverage is the
coverage of the itemset less this amount.<br>
