<p>While <b>Magnum Opus</b> is designed for analyzing large data sets, when the data set
is too large to be retained in memory, processing is dramatically slowed. </p>

<p>The <tt>proportion</tt> option instructs <b>Magnum Opus</b> to sample the data as it is
imported. The argument to this option is a number between 0.0 and 1.0. This indicates the
proportion of cases in the data that should be randomly included in the analysis. For
example, <tt>mocl item-list-file=tutorial.itl proportion=0.1</tt> will include in the
analysis 0.1 (10%) of the cases in the data.</p>

<p>If the <tt>out-of-sample-holdout-evaluation</tt> <a href="MOCLcommands.html">command line
argument</a> is specified, the data that is not included in the sample will be used for <a
href="MOCLholdout.html">holdout evaluation</a>.</p>
