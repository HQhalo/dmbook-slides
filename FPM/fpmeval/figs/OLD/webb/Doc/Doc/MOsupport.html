<h1><font color="#000080"> Rule support</font></h1>

<p>The support of a <a href="MOassociation_rule.html">rule</a> is the number of
cases in the data that are <a href="MOcover.html">covered</a> by both the Left Hand
Side and the Right Hand Side of the rule. <b>Magnum Opus</b> uses both proportional 
and count representations of this metric.  The support count is the raw count of these cases.  The support proportion is the support count divided by the total number of cases in the data.</p>

<p>For instance, suppose that there are 1000 cases and the LHS and RHS jointly cover
100 cases. The support count is 100 and the  support proportion is 100/1000 = 0.1. </p>
