<p class="MsoNormal">The significance of a <a href="MOassociation_rule.html">rule</a> 
is the result of a statistical test to assess the likelihood that the strength 
of the rule is actually higher than that of its generalizations.&nbsp; A Fisher exact 
test is used to compare the rule&#8217;s strength to that of every rule that can be 
formed by deleting a single condition from the Left-Hand-Side of the rule.&nbsp; A 
further Fisher Exact Test is used to compare the strength of the rule to the 
frequency with which the Right-Hand-Side occurs in the data as a whole.&nbsp; The 
largest <i>p</i> value is reported.&nbsp; A small significance value indicates the 
rule probably represents an improvement on all of its generalizations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The significance of an <a href="MOitemset.html">itemset</a> 
is the smallest <i>p</i> value for tests for improvement relative to each 
partition of the itemset. A small significance value indicates that the itemset 
probably represents a real improvement upon all of its subsets.</p>
