<h1><font color="#000080">Getting Started with the Magnum Opus Command
Line System</font></h1>

<p><b>Magnum Opus</b> delivers the power of the most recent advances in 
association 
discovery technology.&nbsp; With unrivalled flexibility and ease-of-use, it 
finds new and unanticipated&nbsp;associations from data. Use <b>Magnum Opus</b> to unlock the wealth of information
implicit within your data assets.</p>

<p><strong>Magnum Opus</strong> employs unique <em>k-optimal</em> (also known as
<i>top-k</i>)<i> </i>association discovery
techniques.&nbsp; Tell <strong>Magnum Opus</strong> what makes a 
association
interesting to you and how many you would like.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Magnum Opus</strong> 
delivers the&nbsp;associations that are most interesting according
to the measure that you select.&nbsp; <strong>Magnum Opus</strong> does all the hard work
but lets you make all the decisions.</p>

<p>Other systems either employ undisclosed proprietary heuristics that select a 
few associations for you, or indiscriminately present countless&nbsp;associations that bury the gems amongst the
dross.&nbsp; In contrast, <strong>Magnum Opus</strong> will always deliver 
exactly the associations that maximize the  measure that you select,
within whatever other constraints you choose.&nbsp; These further constraints include
unrivalled facilities for detecting and discarding spurious 'discoveries'.</p>

<p><strong>Magnum Opus</strong> is the only system that supports statistically sound&nbsp;association discovery.</p>

<p>Some important features: 

<ul>
  <li><b>Magnum Opus</b> is <b>easy to use</b> and does not presume
advanced knowledge of statistics or machine learning.</li>
  <li><b>Magnum Opus</b> associations are expressed in forms that are <b>simple
to understand</b>. </li>
  <li><strong>Magnum Opus</strong> includes a unique facility&nbsp;to <a
 href="MOfiltering.html"><b>automatically filter out associations</b></a>
that are unlikely to be of interest, and includes the unique ability to
perform <b><a href="MOCLholdout.html">statistically sound exploratory
	association discovery</a></b>. </li>
  <li>Unlike&nbsp;other&nbsp;association discovery systems, <strong>Magnum Opus</strong> does not rely on
    sparse data for efficient processing. </li>
  <li><strong>Magnum Opus</strong> finds associations from both transaction data and attribute-value
    data. </li>
  <li><b>Magnum Opus</b> has been designed to analyze <b>substantial databases</b> containing
    millions of records.</li>
  <li><b>Magnum Opus</b> is <b>fast</b>. It has <b>linear compute time</b>.
	So long as your data fit in your computer's 
	physical memory, if the amount of data is doubled then the compute time will 
	approximately double.</li>
  <li><b>Magnum Opus</b> is <b>flexible</b>.&nbsp; The different search options
    support a wide range of differing analytic objectives.</li>
</ul>
