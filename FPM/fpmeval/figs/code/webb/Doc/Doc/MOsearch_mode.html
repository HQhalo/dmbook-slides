<p><b>Magnum Opus</b> supports five search modes for association discovery, search by <a href="MOleverage.html">leverage</a>,
<a href="MOlift.html">lift</a>, <a href="MOstrength.html">strength</a>, <a
href="MOcoverage.html">coverage</a>, and <a href="MOsupport.html">support</a>. 
Two search modes are provided for itemset discovery, search by <a href="MOleverage.html">leverage</a> 
and <a
href="MOcoverage.html">coverage</a>. The only difference between these modes is 
that <b>Magnum Opus</b> finds the&nbsp;rules 
or itemsets with the
highest value of the respective measure of interestingness in each mode.&nbsp;
For example, when Search Mode is set to Leverage, Magnum Opus finds the
associations with the highest leverage, and when Search Mode is set to Strength,
Magnum Opus finds the associations with the highest strength. </p>

<p>Under any search mode, <b>Magnum Opus</b> finds the number of rules or 
itemsets specified by the
user, guaranteeing that those found are those with the highest values on the specified
measure out of those that satisfy the user specified constraints. <b>Magnum Opus</b> 
will only find fewer than the specified number of associations if the search is terminated by the user or
there are fewer than the specified number that satisfy the user specified
constraints. </p>

<p>The associations that are found are listed in the output file
in descending order on the measure specified by the current search mode. </p>
