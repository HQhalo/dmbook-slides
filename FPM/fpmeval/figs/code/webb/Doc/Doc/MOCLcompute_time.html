<p>Rule discovery by its very nature has very high computation requirements. <b>Magnum
Opus</b> uses the computationally efficient OPUS search algorithm. However, even the most
efficient search algorithm will be overcome by the requirements of some rule searches that
can be devised. </p>

<p>In general the following actions will decrease compute time. 

<ul>
  <li>Increase the minimum <a href="MOleverage.html">leverage</a> (minimum-leverage option).</li>
  <li>Increase the minimum <a href="MOcoverage.html">coverage</a> (minimum-coverage option).</li>
  <li>Increase the minimum <a href="MOsupport.html">support</a> (minimum-support option).</li>
  <li>Decrease the maximum size (maximum-size option).</li>
  <li>Decrease the maximum number of results to be found (maximum-results option).</li>
  <li>Decrease the number of values allowed in a pattern
    (items-available, items-excluded, lhs-available, lhs-exclude, rhs-available and rhs-exclude options).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note, increasing the minimum lift or strength will only decrease compute time if
<a href="MOmestimate.html">m-estimates</a> are used (m option) or the
minimum coverage or support is set to a high value. </p>

<p>Search by lift and search by strength are both substantially faster if <a href="MOmestimate.html">m-estimates</a>
(m option) are used. </p>

<p><b>Magnum Opus</b> stores all data in memory during computation. The single greatest
factor that will increase compute time will be when memory requirements exceed available
RAM and the system starts utilizing virtual memory. The slow access times for virtual
memory greatly increase overall compute time. </p>

<p>The following steps may alleviate compute slowdown caused by utilization of virtual
memory. 

<ul>
  <li>Increase the amount of memory installed in the host computer.</li>
  <li>Reduce the number of attributes utilized from the data.</li>
  <li>Reduce the number of attribute values considered during search by
    using the items-available, items-excluded, lhs-available, lhs-exclude, rhs-available, and rhs-exclude options.</li>
  <li>Reduce the number of cases to be analyzed, for example, by using the proportion option.</li>
</ul>

<p>The data format can also greatly affect processing time.&nbsp; If the data consist of
objects that are either present or absent and you are interested only in associations
between the presence of objects, then either the <a href="MOCLItemListFile.html">item-list</a>
or <a href="MOCLId-ItemFile.html">identifier-item</a> file format will result in faster
processing than the <a href="MOCLDataTypes.html">name file - data file</a> format.&nbsp; The
item-list format is more efficient than the identifier-item format.&nbsp; Where
applicable, using the <tt>ordered</tt> command line option will greatly speed up
processing of identifier-item data.</p>
