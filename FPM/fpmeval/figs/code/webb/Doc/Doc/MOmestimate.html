<p>Calculating the <a href="MOstrength.html">strength</a> and <a href="MOlift.html">lift</a> of a <a href="MOassociation_rule.html">rule</a>
directly from the available data will often result in values that do not reflect
likely strength and lift on future data. For example, consider a database in
which the records relate to customers and, among other information, the age and
gender are recorded. For ease of explanation we will assume that half the
customers are male and half female. Suppose, however, that there is only one
customer who is ninety years old and that this customer happens to be female. As
all ninety-year-olds in the data are female, the rule <tt>age=90
-&gt; female</tt> will have strength=1.0 and hence lift=2.0.
While it might be the case that for our application all ninety-year-olds will be
female, in the absence of further relevant information this single example does
not warrant concluding so. Typically we would want many more examples before we
would conclude that the likely strength was even close to 1.0. Note, however,
that this one example does provide some evidence that more ninety-year-olds will
be female than male as it rules out the possibility that no ninety-year-olds are
female, but does not rule out the possibility that no ninety-year-olds are male.</p>
<p>The m-estimate provides a form of Bayesian estimate of the likely value of
strength and lift for a rule given a finite sample of cases. It takes into
account the number of examples that the rule <a href="MOcover.html">covers</a>, the strength
of the rule given those examples, and the frequency of the RHS in the data as a
whole. It adjusts the observed strength toward the latter value. The size of the
adjustment depends upon the cover of the rule and on a user-specified value <i>m</i>.
The formulae are</p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Strength estimate</i> = (<i>support</i> + <i>m</i> * <i>prior</i>)
/ (<i>coverage</i> + <i>m</i>)</p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Lift estimate</i> = <i>strength estimate</i> / <i>prior</p>
</i>
<p>where <i>prior</i> is the frequency of the RHS in the data as a whole.</p>
<p>For our example rule <tt>age=90 -&gt;
female</tt>, <i>support </i>= 1 (because there is one female
ninety-year-old), <i>coverage</i> = 1 (because there is one ninety-year-old) and
<i>prior</i> = 0.5 (because half the customers are female). If <i>m</i> = 2, <i>strength
estimate </i>= 0.75 and <i>lift estimate</i> = 1.5. If <i>m</i> is increased
then more weight is placed on the prior. For example, with <i>m</i> = 10, <i>strength
estimate</i> = 0.545 and <i>lift estimate</i> = 1.091.</p>
<p>In the interactive system the m-estimate check box is used to control whether 
an m-estimate is used.&nbsp; In the commend line system the <tt>m</tt> command 
is used.</p>
