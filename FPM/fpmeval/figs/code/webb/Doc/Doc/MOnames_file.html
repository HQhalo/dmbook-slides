<h1> <font color="#000080">Names file</font></h1>

<p>A names file is required for attribute-value data analysis.&nbsp;
It is a text file that lists the <a href="MOattribute.html">attributes</a> that describe
the <a href="MOcase.html">cases</a> in the <a href="MOdata_file.html">data file</a> to be
analyzed. </p>

<p>Each attribute is described on a separate line. </p>

<p>Each line starts with the name of the attribute. </p>

<p>For categorical attributes, the attribute name is followed by a colon (:) and then
either the keyword <tt>categorical</tt> or a comma
separated list of the values allowed for the attribute. </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><tt>Department: bakery, dairy, beverages</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This specifies that the attribute Department can assume any one of the three values bakery,
dairy, or beverages.&nbsp; Any case containing any other value will be discarded and an
error message generated.</p>

<p>Example: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><tt>Department: categorical</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This specifies that the attribute Department can assume any value that appears in the
data file.</p>

<p>For compatibility with See-5, Magnum Opus also accepts the keyword <tt>discrete</tt>
which is treated as equivalent to <tt>categorical</tt>. </p>

<p>Numeric attributes must be divided into <a href="MOsub-range.html">sub-ranges</a>.&nbsp;
These can be specified in the names file.&nbsp; Alternatively, the names file can simply
identify the number of sub-ranges and Magnum Opus will select the sub-ranges for you. </p>

<p>For a numeric attribute with specified sub-ranges, the attribute name is followed by a
list of sub-range cut points. These indicate how the numeric values for the attribute are
to be subdivided into sub-ranges. Each cut point is introduced by one of the relations <tt>&lt;</tt> or <tt>&lt;=</tt> which is followed
by the value that terminates the sub-range. If the relation is <tt>&lt;</tt>,
the sub-range includes all values less than the specified value. If the relation is <tt>&lt;=</tt>, the sub-range includes all values less than or equal to
the specified value. </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><tt>Spend &lt; 10 &lt;= 100</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This specifies that the attribute Spend has three sub-ranges, below the first cut
point, between the two cut points, and above the last cut point: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><tt>Spend &lt; 10</tt> </p>
  <p><tt>10 &lt;= Spend &lt;= 100</tt> </p>
  <p><tt>Spend &gt; 100</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To allow Magnum Opus to select sub-ranges, use the keyword <tt>numeric</tt>, followed
by the number of sub-ranges required. </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><tt>Spend: numeric 5</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For compatibility with See-5, Magnum Opus also accepts the keyword <tt>continuous</tt>
which is treated as <tt>numeric 3</tt>. </p>

<p>Magnum Opus will try to create the requested number of sub-ranges, each covering the same number of cases from the data. However, if many cases have the same value this may not be possible. In this circumstance, some sub-ranges may cover more cases than others, or fewer than the requested number of sub-ranges may be created.</p>

<p>The keyword <tt>ignore</tt>
instructs Magnum Opus to discard any data for the given attribute. This is
useful for handling attributes that may appear in the data but which should not
be used, such as record identifiers.
</p>

<p>A categorical attribute declaration can be followed by any 
number of generalization declarations.&nbsp; A generalization declares a new value 
for an attribute that is equivalent to a group of previously declared values.&nbsp; 
Each generalization declaration appears on a separate line, starting with a 
colon (<tt>:</tt>).&nbsp; This must 
be followed by a name for the generalization.&nbsp; This is followed in turn by 
another colon.&nbsp; Then appears a list of values to which the new value is 
equivalent.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<tt>&nbsp; Amino Acid 1: A,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,N,P,Q,R,S,T,V,W,Y</tt></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><tt>&nbsp; : 
small: G,A,S</tt></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><tt>&nbsp; : 
medium: C,D,T,N,P,E,V,Q,H,M,I,L,K</tt></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><tt>&nbsp; : 
large: W,F,Y,R</tt></p>

<p>In this example an attribute called <tt>Amino Acid 1</tt> is declared with 20 
initial values.&nbsp; The next three lines declare three further values, each of 
which only applies when the corresponding initial values apply.&nbsp; So, if the data 
file contains the value <tt>A</tt> 
for this attribute then the attribute will be assigned two values, both <tt>A</tt> 
and <tt>small</tt>.</p>

<p>Attribute names can consist of any sequence of printable characters other than colon (<tt>:</tt>)
and less than (<tt>&lt;</tt>).
</p>

<p>
Attribute value names can consist of any sequence of printable characters other than comma
(<tt>,</tt>). Although names may be any length, Magnum Opus only considers the first 50
characters of the name. The special name `<tt>?</tt>&#146; is reserved for missing values.
</p>

<p>The names file must list the attributes in the order that they appear in the data file.
</p>

<p>Magnum Opus ignores any line beginning with a comment character (<tt>|</tt>). <br>
