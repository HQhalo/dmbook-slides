<p>The leverage of a <a href="MOassociation_rule.html">rule</a> is the number of
additional cases <a href="MOcover.html">covered</a> by both the LHS and RHS above those
expected if the LHS and RHS were independent of each other. This is a measure of the
importance of the rule that reflects both the <a href="MOstrength.html">strength</a> and
the <a href="MOcoverage.html">coverage</a> of the rule.</p>

<p><b>Magnum Opus</b> uses both proportional 
and count representations of leverage.  The leverage count is the raw count of these cases.  The leverage proportion is the leverage count divided by the total number of cases in the data.</p>


<p>For example, suppose that there are 1000 cases, the LHS or a rule covers 200 cases, the RHS
covers 100 cases, and the RHS covers 50 of the cases covered by the LHS. The
proportion of examples covered by both the LHS and RHS is 50/1000 = 0.05. The number
of examples that would be expected to be covered by both the LHS and RHS if they were
independent of each other is 200 * 100 / 1000 = 20. The leverage count is 50 minus
20 = 30.  The leverage proportion equals the leverage count divided 1000 which equals 0.03.</p>

<p>The leverage of an <a href="MOitemset.html">itemset</a> is the number of additional cases covered by the 
itemset above the maximum expected if any disjoint subsets of the itemset were 
independent of each other.&nbsp; <span lang="EN-US">This is determined by forming all 
splits of the itemset into two subsets and calculating the expected coverage of 
the itemset assuming those subsets are independent.&nbsp; This is the product of the 
coverage of each subset.&nbsp; The leverage is the coverage of the itemset minus the 
maximum of these expected values.&nbsp; The leverage of a one-element itemset is 
0.0.&nbsp; The leverage of a two-element itemset is the same as the leverage of a 
rule with one element as the LHS and the other as the RHS.&nbsp; The leverage of a 
multi-element itemset can never be higher than the maximum leverage of a rule 
with one of the elements on the RHS and the remaining elements on the LHS.</span></p>

<p>For an example of itemset leverage, 
suppose that there are 1000 cases, A covers 500, B covers 400, C covers 300, A &amp; 
B 333, A &amp; C covers 300, B &amp; C covers 300 and A &amp; B &amp; C covers 300.&nbsp; The itemset 
A &amp; B &amp; C can be divided into each of the three following partitions</p>
<blockquote><p>A &amp; B : C, expected 
coverage = 0.3330 &times; 0.3000 = 0.0999</p>
<p>A &amp; C : B, expected 
coverage = 0.3000 &times; 0.4000 = 0.1200</p>
<p>B &amp; C : A, expected 
coverage = 0.3000 &times; 0.5000 = 0.1500</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The maximum expected coverage is 0.1500.&nbsp; The actual 
coverage of A &amp; B &amp; C is 300 / 1000 = 0.3000.&nbsp; The actual coverage minus the 
maximum expected coverage is 0.1500, and hence this is the leverage of the 
itemset.</p>
